NMSliderViewController
======================

Yup, another sliding view controller.

I made this for two reasons:

+ I wanted to learn more about UIGestureRecognizers
+ All the versions of this I've found are just not for me.

This repo holds the code for NMSliderViewController.  This will be updated with a link to a demo soon.
